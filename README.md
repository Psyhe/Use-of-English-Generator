# Use of English Generator

The project scrapes BBC articles and transforms them into Use of English tasks, where users are supposed to fill in the gaps.

Version 1.0:
The current version includes a fixed article for language exercises.
The graphical user interface (GUI) is not implemented in this version but is planned for future extensions.
