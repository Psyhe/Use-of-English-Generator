# Use of English Generator

The project scrapes BBC articles and transforms them into Use of English tasks, where users are supposed to fill in the gaps.

Version 1.1: 
The user has the option to submit a link to a chosen BBC article to generate a new file. Additionally, they can select a file from which the task will be generated.

The graphical user interface (GUI) is not implemented in this version but is planned for future extensions.

Example of articles:
